/**
  @defgroup viz 3D Visualizer

This section describes 3D visualization window as well as classes and methods that are used to
interact with it.

3D visualization window (see Viz3d) is used to display widgets (see Widget), and it provides several
methods to interact with scene and widgets.

@{
    @defgroup viz_widget Widget

    In this section, the widget framework is explained. Widgets represent 2D or 3D objects, varying from
    simple ones such as lines to complex ones such as point clouds and meshes.

    Widgets are **implicitly shared**. Therefore, one can add a widget to the scene, and modify the
    widget without re-adding the widget.

    @code
    // Create a cloud widget
    viz::WCloud cw(cloud, viz::Color::red());
    // Display it in a window
    myWindow.showWidget("CloudWidget1", cw);
    // Modify it, and it will be modified in the window.
    cw.setColor(viz::Color::yellow());
    @endcode
