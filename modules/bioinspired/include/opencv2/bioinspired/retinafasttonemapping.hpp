/** @brief  a wrapper class which allows the tone mapping algorithm of Meylan&al(2007) to be used with OpenCV.

This algorithm is already implemented in thre Retina class (retina::applyFastToneMapping) but used it does not require all the retina model to be allocated. This allows a light memory use for low memory devices (smartphones, etc.
As a summary, these are the model properties:
- 2 stages of local luminance adaptation with a different local neighborhood for each.
- first stage models the retina photorecetors local luminance adaptation
- second stage models th ganglion cells local information adaptation
- compared to the initial publication, this class uses spatio-temporal low pass filters instead of spatial only filters.
  this can help noise robustness and temporal stability for video sequence use cases.

for more information, read to the following papers :

    using only the 2 local adaptation stages of the retina parvocellular channel : photoreceptors
    level and ganlion cells level. Spatio temporal filtering is applied but limited to temporal
    smoothing and eventually high frequencies attenuation. This is a lighter method than the one
    available using the regular retina::run method. It is then faster but it does not include
    complete temporal filtering nor retina spectral whitening. Then, it can have a more limited
    effect on images with a very high dynamic range. This is an adptation of the original still
