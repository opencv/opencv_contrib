# Computer Vision based Alpha Matting

![Trimap Alphamat Example from Askoy et al 2017](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/assets/810997/5cafae51-18e1-4e75-9035-6b40c9a064cb)

Alphamatting is the problem of extracting the foreground from an image. Given the input of an image and its corresponding trimap, we try to extract the foreground from the background.

This project is implementation of "[Designing Effective Inter-Pixel Information Flow for Natural Image Matting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318489370_Designing_Effective_Inter-Pixel_Information_Flow_for_Natural_Image_Matting)" by Yağız Aksoy, Tunç Ozan Aydın and Marc Pollefeys[1]. It required implementation of parts of other papers [2,3,4].
