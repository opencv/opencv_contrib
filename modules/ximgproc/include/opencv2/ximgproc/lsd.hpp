    Vec4f is (x1, y1, x2, y2), point 1 is the start, point 2 - end. Returned lines are strictly
    oriented depending on the gradient.
    @param width Vector of widths of the regions, where the lines are found. E.g. Width of line.
    @param prec Vector of precisions with which the lines are found.
    @param nfa Vector containing number of false alarms in the line region, with precision of 10%. The
    bigger the value, logarithmically better the detection.
    - -1 corresponds to 10 mean false alarms
    - 0 corresponds to 1 mean false alarm
    - 1 corresponds to 0.1 mean false alarms
    This vector will be calculated only when the objects type is #LSD_REFINE_ADV.

The LineSegmentDetector algorithm is defined using the standard values. Only advanced users may want

@param scale The scale of the image that will be used to find the lines. Range (0..1].
@param sigma_scale Sigma for Gaussian filter. It is computed as sigma = sigma_scale/scale.
@param quant Bound to the quantization error on the gradient norm.
@param ang_th Gradient angle tolerance in degrees.
@param log_eps Detection threshold: -log10(NFA) \> log_eps. Used only when advance refinement is chosen.
