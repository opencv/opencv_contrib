## Patent Information

To the best of our knowledge, the implemented algorithms (SRGAN and RDN) are not encumbered by patents that would restrict their use in this project. These implementations are based on academic research papers and are provided for academic and research purposes.

## Usage

The dnn_superres module allows for super-resolution using neural networks. The network takes as input a image of a certain size, and outputs a larger one. Here's a brief example of how to use the provided C++ API:

```c++
using namespace std;
using namespace cv;
using namespace dnn_superres;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    cv::Mat img = cv::imread("img.png");
    cv::Mat img_new;

    // Create the Dnn Superres object
    cv::dnn_superres::DnnSuperResImpl sr;

    // Read the desired model
    path = "models/FSRCNN_x4.pb"
    sr.readModel(path);

    // Set the desired model and scale to get correct pre- and post-processing
    sr.setModel("fsrcnn", 4);

    // Upscale
    sr.upsample(img, img_new);

    // Save the result
    cv::imwrite("./img_upscaled.png", img_new);

    return 0;
}
```

Run the following command to build this module:

```make
cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<opencv_contrib>/modules -Dopencv_dnn_superres=ON <opencv_source_dir>
```

Refer to the tutorials to understand how to use this module.

## Models

There are four models which are trained.

#### EDSR

Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow/tree/master/models).

- Size of the model: ~38.5MB. This is a quantized version, so that it can be uploaded to GitHub. (Original was 150MB.)
- This model was trained for 3 days with a batch size of 16
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: Highly accurate
- Disadvantage: Slow and large filesize
- Speed: < 3 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [1]

#### ESPCN

Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN/tree/master/export).

- Size of the model: ~100kb
- This model was trained for ~100 iterations with a batch size of 32
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: It is tiny and fast, and still performs well.
- Disadvantage: Perform worse visually than newer, more robust models.
- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.

- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow
- Advantage: Fast, small and accurate

- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Notes: FSRCNN-small has fewer parameters, thus less accurate but faster.
